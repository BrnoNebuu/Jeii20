3. **SINCE WHEN...**
   - I KNOW ENGLISH LANGUAGE: I began studying English language in 2014 (4th grade), but truly improved in my 7th grade (2017) â€“ reading these days is not an issue for me anymore, since I understand what context it is;
   - I ENDED MY HIGHSCHOOL: My last year at a highschool was in 2022 â€“ let's begin the superior level! I don't miss the school ambient, but I miss studying ngl;
   - I JOINED NEBULOUS.IO: I joined exactly on 15 November 2016 at 18:24 (UTC-2, with Summertime) â€“ however, I had a stop in 2019, returned in 2021;
   - I BEGAN TRANSLATING FOR NEBULOUS.IO: Bruh, I took an age where translations for my language were REALLY messed up, in May 2024 â€“ approved as a trustable translator on 18 June 2024;
   - I CREATED THIS GITHUB ACCOUNT: I joined GitHub in August 2024, especially for the Nebulous.io translations â€“ c'mon, I learned a lot of stuff here in a really very short time! And plus, this went as an opportunity to manage MANY other languages I know at least a little;
   - I KNEW MY WORLD'S BEST FRIEND: Again about her, I knew that lovely girl in 9 July 2023, as expected, under Nebulous.io, so this year was been my REAL best in all my life â€“ surely 2024, 2025, 2026 and others will ALSO be, while she exists in my life, ilysm, Nicole <3.

That's all I would like to share about me, but FOR NOW though. Thanks for reading until reach here <3
